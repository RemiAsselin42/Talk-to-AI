# My Electron Express App

This project is an Electron application that utilizes an Express server to provide speech-to-text and text-to-speech services using Google's APIs. The application is designed to run securely over HTTPS.

## Project Structure

```

├── src
│   ├── main.js          # Main entry point for the Electron application
│   ├── server.js        # Sets up an HTTPS server using Express
│   ├── renderer.js      # Handles front-end logic and user interactions
│   └── index.html       # Main HTML file for the renderer process
├── certs
│   ├── localhost.pem    # SSL certificate for the HTTPS server
│   └── localhost-key.pem # Private key associated with the SSL certificate
├── package.json         # Configuration file for npm
├── electron-builder.json # Configuration for building the Electron app
└── README.md            # Documentation for the project
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-electron-express-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the Electron application and the Express server on port 3000.

## Building the Application

To create an executable (.exe) file for the application, run the following command:
```
npm run build
```

This will use the configuration specified in `electron-builder.json` to package the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the user interface to utilize the speech-to-text and text-to-speech features. Make sure your microphone and speakers are properly configured for the best experience.
